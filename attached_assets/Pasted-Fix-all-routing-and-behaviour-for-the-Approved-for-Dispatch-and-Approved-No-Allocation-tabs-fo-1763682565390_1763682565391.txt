Fix all routing and behaviour for the “Approved for Dispatch” and “Approved (No Allocation)” tabs for both LM and LO. Do NOT change the database schema; keep existing DRIMS UI style.

1. Tab visibility & scope (LM vs LO)

Logistics Manager (LM) view on the Relief Request Fulfillment page must:

Show both tabs: “Approved for Dispatch” and “Approved (No Allocation)”.

Logistics Officer (LO) view must:

Show the same tabs only for requests they are associated with (created/prepared by them or in their scope).

Neither LM nor LO should see requests that are unrelated to them (respect existing ownership/assignment filters).

2. “Approved for Dispatch” tab – routing & click behaviour

The “Approved for Dispatch” tab must list all packages that:

Have been approved by the LM, and

Have items allocated (> 0) and are ready for Inventory Clerk dispatch.

When LM or LO clicks a row in this tab:

For LM: open the correct read-only approval/summary page for that package (e.g. Approve/Review Relief Package summary view).

For LO: open a read-only summary view showing what was approved and allocated.

Ensure these clicks do not route back to any “Being Prepared” or wrong preparation pages.

Any “View details” / hyperlink / tracking number click must point to one consistent detail route for LM and one for LO (if they differ), both showing the correct approved state.

3. “Approved (No Allocation)” tab – routing & click behaviour

The “Approved (No Allocation)” tab must list only packages that:

Are approved by the LM, and

Have no items allocated (all issue/allocated quantities = 0).

When LM or LO clicks a row in this tab:

Open a read-only summary view that clearly shows:

Requested items

Zero allocation/issue quantities

Status such as “Unavailable / No Stock / No Allocation”.

Ensure this view is not the dispatch preparation or allocation screen.

All links (tracking ID, “View details”, etc.) from this tab must consistently route to that correct read-only “No Allocation” summary page.

4. Correct routing targets

Verify and update all routing so that:

From “Approved for Dispatch”, LM and LO always land on the approved-with-allocation detail page.

From “Approved (No Allocation)”, LM and LO always land on the approved-with-no-allocation detail page.

No tab or link sends users back to Being Prepared or to the wrong role’s page.

Fix any hard-coded or outdated routes so they use the correct URL patterns:

e.g. /fulfillment/approved/<package_id>

/fulfillment/approved-no-allocation/<package_id>
(or whatever the existing patterns are in the app — reuse them consistently).

5. General

Do not alter the workflow statuses themselves, only the filters and routing for these two tabs.

Keep the tab names, styling, and overall navigation consistent with the rest of DRIMS.

Make sure back buttons/breadcrumbs from the detail pages return to the correct tab (Approved for Dispatch vs Approved (No Allocation)) for both LM and LO.
